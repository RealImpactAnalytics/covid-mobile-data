# Notebook organization

The [aggregation_master.py](https://github.com/worldbank/covid-mobile-data/tree/cdr-master/cdr-aggregation/notebooks/aggregation_master.py) script is currently set to run all flowminder, priority and scaled indicators. Additional custom indicators are left out.

The [aggregation_master.ipynb](https://github.com/worldbank/covid-mobile-data/tree/cdr-master/cdr-aggregation/notebooks/aggregation_master.py) notebook does the same and can be used for data exploration, too.

The [aggregation_master_databricks.py](https://github.com/worldbank/covid-mobile-data/tree/cdr-master/cdr-aggregation/notebooks/aggregation_master_databricks.py) notebook is customised for databricks.
